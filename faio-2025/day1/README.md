## Problem 1: Qaz-letters

**Task Description:**  
You need to build a machine learning model for automatic Kazakh letter classification. The dataset contains only numerical features extracted from images: statistical, geometric, projection, and transform-based features — not raw images.

**What to do:**  
Train a classification model that predicts the correct Kazakh letter based on the given features.

**Metric:**  
Performance is evaluated using Accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified letters.  
The metric ranges from 0 to 1 (1 means all letters are classified correctly, 0 means none are correct).

## Problem 2: Who is the best pitcher?

**Task Description:**  
Build a RAG-powered question-answering agent for Major League Baseball (MLB). The goal is to answer baseball-related questions using large, structured JSON datasets about teams, players, games, seasons, and records.

**What to do:**  
Develop a system that ingests and parses JSON data, organizes it for knowledge retrieval, and uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture to generate accurate answers to MLB questions.

**Metric:**  
Accuracy is the evaluation metric — the number of correct answers divided by total questions.  
The metric ranges from 0 to 1 (1 means all answers are correct, 0 means none are correct).

## Problem 3: Misssing fundamental puzzle
**Task Description:**  
Build a pitch classification model for musical audio illusions. The goal is to identify the original musical note (e.g., C4, G#5) from audio samples in which the fundamental frequency and several harmonics have been removed.

**What to do:**  
Develop a system that analyzes mono WAV files (22050 Hz). Each file is a musical excerpt with missing frequencies—your model must reconstruct the pitch label from the spectral pattern of the remaining harmonics.

**Metric:**  
Accuracy is the evaluation metric — the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of examples.  
The metric ranges from 0 to 1 (1 means all answers are correct, 0 means none are correct).
