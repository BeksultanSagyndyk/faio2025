Welcome to the Fizmat AI Olympiad 2025, online selection stage!

Whether you make it to the final or not doesn't matter — the most important thing is to keep learning and stay interested in machine learning. Don't hesitate to ask questions in the future; we'll be happy to help.

The goal of FAIO is not to divide students into "strong" and "not strong." Our goal is to help you fall in love with ML, give you a chance to try it, and motivate you to study ML by holding events like this.  
Good luck and have a fair competition :)

## Problem 1

**The correct answer to this problem is worth 10 points.**

## Problem Statement

There are 10 students in a class. Each of them reported how many pets they have. The numbers were as follows:

$$
2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1
$$

1. Find the mean number of pets.  
2. Determine the mode.  
3. Find the median.

## Theory

**Mean**  
The arithmetic mean is the result of dividing the sum of all numbers in a set by their total count.  
*Example in data analysis:* The average customer purchase amount.  
*Example in ML:* Mean Squared Error (MSE).

**Mode**  
*Formal definition:* value that appears most often in a set of data values.  
*Example in data analysis:* The most popular item in an online store.  
*Example in ML:* Choosing the final class by model voting.

**Median**  
*Simple explanation:* It's the middle value in an ordered list of numbers.  
*Formal definition:* The median divides a dataset in half — 50% of the values are smaller, and 50% are larger.  
*Example in data analysis:* Median salary.  
*Example in ML:* Median Absolute Error.

## Answer Format
Output three numbers on a single line, separated by a space: first the mean, then the mode, and then the median.
